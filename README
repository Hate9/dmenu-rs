dmenu-rs - dynamic menu
=======================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.  
dmenu-rs is a 1:1 port of dmenu rewritten in Rust. It looks, feels, and
runs pixel-for-pixel exactly the same. However, it has a few improvements.

Why Rust?
=========
Inspiration
-----------
This project started with dmenu-calc.
Initially, I wanted much more function than what is provided by bc. However, I
found the bottleneck to be a lack of functionality and modability in dmenu(1)
itself. So, the choice I had was to either mod dmenu(1) or rewrite it. Because
dmenu source is horrendously annoying to read, I decided to rewrite it in a
language which lends itself to writing code that is easier to modify. There are
other languages for this, but I like Rust.
------------
Improvements
------------
As mentioned earlier, dmenu-rs runs exactly the same as dmenu. However, there
are some significant performance enhancements under the hood. The most impactful
is memmory usage: dmenu-rs uses 21.65% less memmory[1], while managing it much
more safely without any performance impacts.

Requirements
============
- Xlib header files  
- Cargo / rustc  
- A working C compiler

Installation
============
Standalone
----------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):  

         make clean install

Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details. For a quick test, run:  

         make test
